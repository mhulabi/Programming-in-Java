Assumption:
I automated the processes if customers coming into the bank and saying their type because it is to tedious to do manually.
Every while loop iteration a random sleep between 0 to 2 seconds occur and two customers approach the bank. 
Sometimes its 1 vip and 1 regular.
other times 2 vip.
other times 2 regular.
PLEASE NOTE BECAUSE OF THIS, THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF MAXIMUM CUSTOMERS MUST BE 2. TO PREVENT ERRORS.
I am writing this to clarify the implemenation of customer arrival.
